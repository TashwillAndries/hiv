            <h4><p class="intro-subtitle">What is hiv?</p></h4>
            <p class="information">HIV is the virus which leads to AIDS. It attacks your immune system, making it easier for you to get sick. HIV is spread during sex, but condoms could facilitate in protecting you.</p>

               <p> HIV is an infection that can lead to AIDS.
                HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. It’s a virus that breaks down certain cells in your immune system (your body’s defense against diseases that helps you stay healthy). When HIV damages your immune system, it’s easier to get really sick and even die from infections that your body could normally fight off.
                Most people with HIV don’t have any symptoms for many years and feel totally fine, so they might not even know they have it.</p>
                
                <p>Once you have HIV, the virus stays in your body for life. There’s no cure for HIV, but medicines can help you stay healthy. HIV medicine lowers or even stops your chances of spreading the virus to other people. Studies show that using HIV treatment as directed can lower the amount of HIV in your blood so much that it might not even show up on a test — when this happens, you can’t transmit HIV through sex.
                
                Treatment is really important (that’s why getting tested is so important). Without treatment, HIV can lead to AIDS. But with medicine, people with HIV can live long, healthy lives and stop the spread of HIV to others.</p>

        <div class="stage-one">
            <h4 class="stage-one-header">Stage 1: Acute HIV Infection</h4>
            <p>People have a large amount of HIV in their blood. They are very contagious.
                But some people may not feel sick right away or at all.
                If you have Óu-like symptoms and think you may have been exposed to HIV, seek medical care
                and ask for a test to diagnose acute infection.
                Only antigen/antibody tests or nucleic acid tests (NATs) can diagnose acute infection.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="stage-two">
            <h4 class="stage-two-header">Stage 2: Chronic HIV Infection</h4>
            <p>This stage is also called asymptomatic HIV infection or clinical latency.
                HIV is still active but reproduces at very low levels.
                People may not have any symptoms or get sick during this phase.</p>
                <p>Without taking HIV medicine, this period may last a decade or longer, but some may progress
                faster.
                People can transmit HIV in this phase.</p>
               <p> At the end of this phase, the amount of HIV in the blood (called viral load) goes up and the CD4 cell count goes down.
                The person may have symptoms as the virus levels increase in the body, and the person moves into Stage 3.
                People who take HIV medicine as prescribed may never move into Stage 3.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="stage-three">
            <h4 class="stage-three-header">Stage 3:Acquired ImmunodeÒciency Syndrome(AIDS)</h4>
            <p>The most severe phase of HIV infection.
                People with AIDS have such badly damaged immune systems that they get an increasing number
                of severe illnesses, called opportunistic infections.</p>
               <p> People receive an AIDS diagnosis when their CD4 cell count drops below 200 cells/mm, or if they
                develop certain opportunistic infections.
                People with AIDS can have a high viral load and be very infectious.
                Without treatment, people with AIDS typically survive about three years</p>
